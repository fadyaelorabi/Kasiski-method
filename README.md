#Steps of the Kasiski Examination
##Identify Repeated Sequences:

Search for sequences of three or more characters that are repeated in the ciphertext.
Record the starting positions of these sequences.
##Determine Distances:

Calculate the distances between the starting positions of each repeated sequence.
List these distances for each repeated sequence.
##Identify Common Factors:

Find the greatest common divisors (GCD) of the distances. The most frequent GCD is likely to be the length of the keyword.
